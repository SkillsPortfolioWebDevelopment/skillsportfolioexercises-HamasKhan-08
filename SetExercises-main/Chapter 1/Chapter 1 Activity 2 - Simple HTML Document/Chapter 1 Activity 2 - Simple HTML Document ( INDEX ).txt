    <h2> Gaming  </h2>

    <p> Gaming is one of the hobbies that is the most close to my heart and basically defines who I am today, as far as I can remember I held a controller when i was 4 and have never put it down  </p>

    <h3> Types Of Games I Like  </h3>

    <p> I mostly like shooting games such as Call Of Duty but i also like some simple platformer games which are animated such as Astro Bot or sackboy, I also like adventure games a lot such as Uncharted and last of Us   </p>

    <h4> What Do I Play On?  </h4>

    <p> I have been a fan of the Sony's Playstation lineup and infact it is the first gaming console i ever owned was the original Playstation, since then i have remained loyal to the Playstation family and currently play games on a Playstation 5   </p>

    <h5> Favourite Sport  </h5>

    <p> I Love playing cricket and football, me and my friends all gather around and decide what to play and im good at both of the sports too  </p>

    <h6> Future Plans   </h6>

    <p> Currently I am studying IT in BathSpa University and hopefully when I am done with my bachelors I can land a good job in a good company and invest in some crypto to have some passive income as well   </p>
